<div class="figc"><p><b><big>Larson couldn't possibly have known what was<br />
going on in the engine room, yet he acted....</big></b></p>

<img src="images/001.png" width="600" height="501" alt="" title="" />
<small><b>There would be hell to pay; Larson was stunting again.</b></small></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"We moor</span> in ten minutes,"
I said.</p>

<p>We were flying at reduced
speed because of the heavy fog we
had run into at the outer fringe of
Earth's atmosphere. But I knew we
were within forty or fifty miles of the
Trans-Space base. I had counted the
miles on this particular trip because of
the load of radium we were carrying
from the Venusian mines. I wouldn't
draw a completely relieved breath until
we were down and the stuff was in the
hands of the commerce agents.</p>

<p>I eased my position slightly to relieve
the pressure on my broken flipper
and grinned at the pilot, Lucky Larson,
the screwiest, most unpredictable void
trotter who had ever flown for dear
old Trans-Space.</p>

<p>"You've been too good to be true this
trip," I said, "and it's a good thing.
The chief told me that if you so much
as <i>thought</i> about clowning around or
stunting he was going to clip your wings
for good."</p>

<p>Lucky grinned, an impish, devil-may-care
grin that lightened up his freckled
face and bunched the tiny wrinkles at
the corners of his eyes. Then with
characteristic abruptness he scowled.</p>

<p>"That grandmother," he said disgustedly.
"Who does he think I am,
anyway? Some crazy irresponsible
madman who hasn't got enough brains
to stay on a space beam?"</p>

<p>"That's just what he does think," I
grinned, "and you've given him plenty
of reason to think it. You can't bring
your crate in to the base without stunting
around and showing off and risking
your damn neck. That's why he sent
me along with you this trip. Just to
see that you act like a pilot&mdash;instead of
circus acrobat."</p>

<p>"A lot of good you'd do," Lucky
mumbled. "You got a broken arm. The
only reason he sent you is because he
didn't want to pay you while you was
in the hospital so he cooks up this trip
to get his money out of you. And say,"
he turned to me belligerently, "when
did I ever crack up a ship? When did
I ever even dent one of the babies?"</p>

<p>"You haven't," I was forced to admit,
"but that's just because of that
screwy luck of yours. But it won't last
forever and one of these days it's going
to run out just when you need it. So
just remember&mdash;no stunting this trip or
you'll be out of the strata for the rest
of your natural life."</p>

<p>"Aw, that's the trouble with this
racket," Lucky grumbled, "a guy can't
have no fun no more. Back when I
was with the Space circus&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Okay, okay," I cut in, "I've heard
that before. Just fly your ship, now,
and forget about the deep dark plot of
the company to take all the joy out of
your life. I'm going to take a look-see
at the atomic floats and get the passengers
bundled together."</p>

<p>I stood up and crawled over him and
opened the door leading to the body of
the ship. I could still hear him grumbling
as I slid the light chrome-alloy
door shut. I chuckled to myself and
headed up the aisle to the baggage compartments.
Lucky Larson was a legend
as space pilots go. An unpredictable,
erratic screwball but one of the finest
rocket riders who ever flashed through
the void.</p>

<p>Company regulations and interplanetary
commissions were the bane
of his existence. He made his own
rules and regulations and got by with
it. That is he <i>had</i> gotten by with it.
Now they were cracking down on him.
He had been grounded twice and the
chief had threatened to set him down
for life if any more infractions were
charged to him. I shook my head
gloomily. He was a great guy, the last
of a great and gallant army of space
adventurers, but he was on the way out.
The rules were necessary, vital to safe
space travel and the Lucky Larsons
would have to live up to them, or else.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">My mind</span> was a long way away
from the cabin of the space ship
and maybe that's why I got what I did.
I didn't see it coming. One minute I
was walking through the aisle, thinking
about Lucky Larson and the next
second something slammed into the
back of my head knocking me to my
knees.</p>

<p>Through a haze of red and white
lights I heard a voice bark, "Toss him
into a chair and grab that good arm of
his."</p>

<p>I wasn't out. Just damn sick. Something
like a cold hand seemed to have
closed over my stomach and for an
awful moment I gagged and tried to
retch. But the moment passed and I
forced open my eyes and focused them
on two tough-looking, hard-eyed gents
who stood in front of me. Another unpleasant-looking
little man knelt along
side of me, twisting my good arm behind
my back.</p>

<p>"Okay," I gritted, "what's the gag?"</p>

<p>The tallest of the three, evidently
their leader, smiled at me. "It's no
gag," he murmured calmly, "we happen
to need the radium you're carrying.
We're going to take it. Any objections?"</p>

<p>"You'll never get away with this,"
I snapped, "your names and descriptions
are registered with the passenger
office. You'll be tracked down in twenty-four
hours."</p>

<p>I was bluffing, of course, and I knew
from their contemptuous smiles that
they knew it, too. They probably had
given fictitious names, and the descriptive
information which the bureau required
consisted of a few generalities,
such as height, weight and the like.
I cursed myself for a stupid, careless
fool. The three men had been the only
passengers from Venus and they had
kept to themselves the entire trip. Once
or twice I had wondered at their reticence
and quietness but I had not been
suspicious enough to make a check-up.</p>

<p>One of the men laughed shortly. "Let
us worry about that. We've covered
every angle that could possibly come up.
With the help of your friend up front,
this ship will be flown to a certain
deserted asteroid where a few friends
of <i>ours</i> are to meet us with another
ship. How you come out afterward
will depend on how you co-operate
now. Clear enough?"</p>

<p>It was clear enough all right. Lucky
and I wouldn't last long after we served
our purpose.</p>

<p>The tall man turned from me and
nodded significantly to the man standing
next to him and then pointed to the
closed door to the pilot's chambers.</p>

<p>"Take care of the pilot," he murmured,
"and tell him if he isn't obliging
we'll take the cast off his friend's
arm and&mdash;" he smiled at me, "massage
it a bit."</p>

<p>I felt a cold sweat break out on my
forehead.</p>

<p>The thug grinned wolfishly at me and
then winked at his leader. "I'll tell him,
boss." He dug his hand into his pocket
and drew out a stubby atomic pistol.
"If he won't listen to me maybe this'll
persuade him."</p>

<p>Still grinning he turned and headed
up the aisle, the gun clenched in his
huge fist.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;glanced</span> at the tall figure standing
in front of me and saw that he
was watching the retreating figure of
his henchman with a saturnine smile
on his face. I thought swiftly. If I
could yell a warning to Lucky, he could
bolt the door of the pilot's chamber and
then set the ship down at the Trans-Space
base. It was the only way to
save Lucky and the radium. I wasn't
very optimistic about my own chances.
I knew they were zero.</p>

<p>I opened my mouth, took a deep
breath and then, before I could scream
the words that would warn Lucky, it
happened. The ship shuddered for an
instant and then zoomed upward, the
smooth hum of the rocket motors crescendoing
to a roaring song of power
and speed.</p>

<p>The sudden jolting acceleration
hurled me to the tail of the ship and
I saw, like an image in a kaleidoscope,
the tangled thrashing figures of the
space bandits as they were tossed to
the floor, a dazedly struggling mass of
arms and legs.</p>

<p>The ship was lying over on its back
in a few seconds, and before I could
catch a breath it suddenly whipped over
and blasted toward Earth in a screeching,
hissing power-dive.</p>

<p>It was terrific punishment even for
this type of space crate but it was worse
for human beings. The three bandits
were clutching at their stomachs as if
they were afraid of losing them. Their
faces were mottled and blotchy and
their eyes were rolling beseechingly.</p>

<p>I didn't mind the erratic convolutions
the ship was making but my arm was
burning as if it were on fire. Numbing
waves of pain were coursing up and
down my entire body.</p>

<p>I tried to crawl to my knees but the
floor rolled under me as the ship
whipped over in a twisting spiral and
I crashed forward on my face. Then
everything dissolved into inky blackness....</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When</span> I came to, I heard a great
commotion, then a sudden shot
and then a babble of voices booming
around me. I remember thinking
fleetingly of crooks, Lucky Larson and
a mountain of radium and then&mdash;because
nothing made sense&mdash;I passed out
again.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The next</span> time I opened my eyes I
found myself stretched out on a cot
in the chief's office. I turned my head
slightly and saw Lucky Larson, the
chief and a half dozen other guys staring
down at me.</p>

<p>"It's not very original," I said, "but
where the hell am I?" That was silly
of me because I knew where I was, so
I said: "Never mind that but please
tell me what the hell happened?"</p>

<p>The chief laughed and Lucky Larson
laughed and then they slapped
each other on the back. "Don't worry
about a thing," the chief said, "those
crooks are under lock and key and
there's not a thing to worry about."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;I mean what...?" My
voice trailed off. Nothing made sense.</p>

<p>"Well," the chief broke in, "Lucky
here really deserves the credit for catching
them. And I'm not forgetting your
good work either. Both of you will
receive more tangible evidence of my
appreciation. But Lucky really did the
brainwork."</p>

<p>"Awww," Lucky mumbled, "it wasn't
much. Just a little common sense and,
uh, a little luck."</p>

<p>"It was damn fast thinking," the
chief cut in belligerently, "you knew
your stunting over the base would drive
me crazy. You knew I'd get so mad I'd
call out the base police and have you
thrown in when you moored. And when
you did moor and the crooks toppled
out we were right on hand to receive
them. They were so weak from the
shaking up you gave them that they
didn't have a chance."</p>

<p>Lucky rolled innocent eyes to the
ceiling. "Sometimes," he remarked
piously, "stunting has its uses."</p>

<p>"Congratulations," I said weakly.
"You certainly used your head. Caught
the chief's attention with your stunting
and almost knocked the crooks out
with it too. That's killing two birds
with one stone, all right." Then another
thought occurred to me.</p>

<p>"How did you know I was in
trouble?" I asked curiously. "How did
you know we had those crooks on
board?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why," Lucky sputtered,
"that was simple. I just happened to
look behind me and I saw those boys
piling into you. So I did a little fast
thinking and then I whipped the ship
into a few maneuvers and, like the
chief says, they caught his eye all
right."</p>

<p>The chief was beaming fondly and
I turned my head to hide the smile on
my lips. "So you just looked behind
you," I muttered. "Well, Lucky, you
certainly are&mdash;and were."</p>

<p>He grinned down at me and winked.
"You said it, kid."</p>

<p>I wanted to ask him a question then,
but I decided to wait until we were
alone. I closed my eyes and smiled
again, thinking of his expression when
I would ask him how he had been able
to look behind him and see me struggling
with those crooks, <i>when the door
of the pilot's chamber was closed all
the time</i>....</p>

<p class="hd1">The End</p>
